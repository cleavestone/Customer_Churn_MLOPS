# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction – End-to-End MLOps Project

This is an end-to-end **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)** project focused on predicting **customer churn** using a real-world dataset. The goal is to develop a robust ML pipeline—from data ingestion to deployment—that can be monitored, versioned, and maintained in production environments.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a critical problem in industries like telecom, banking, and SaaS, where retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project aims to predict which customers are at risk of leaving, enabling proactive retention strategies.

We use data from **ABC Multistate Bank**, which includes demographic and account-related information for each customer. The objective is to build a predictive model that accurately determines whether a customer will churn (leave the bank) based on their profile.

## 📂 Project Highlights

- ✅ Modular ML codebase (components for ingestion, preprocessing, training, and evaluation)
- 🧪 Experiment tracking using **MLflow**
- 📦 Data versioning with **DVC**
- 🧑‍💻 Code versioning & collaboration using **Git + GitHub**
- 🐳 Containerized using **Docker**
- ☁️ Deployment-ready with **Azure Blob Storage**, **CI/CD workflows**, and cloud infrastructure
- 📈 Model & data drift monitoring with **Grafana**
- 📋 Logging and exception handling implemented for reliability

## ✅ Model Training & Evaluation

After completing preprocessing and feature engineering, multiple models were trained and compared:

- 🎯 **Random Forest**
- 🎯 **XGBoostClassifier**
- 🎯 **CatBoostClassifier**
- ✅ **LightGBMClassifier** *(Selected)*

The **LightGBMClassifier** was selected as the final model due to its superior **recall and precision** for the **positive class** (i.e., customers who churned).
